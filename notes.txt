# s6 sequence

Oneshot init phase (strict order):
→ init-config → empty
→ init-selkies → empty
→ init-nginx → ready for test → tested and looks ok
→ init-selkies-config → ready for test → tested and looks ok
→ init-video → skipped (used for setting up GPU)
→ init-selkies-end → empty

Longrun service phase:

Start base services in parallel:
svc-dbus → skipped (should be provided by the running system)
svc-docker → skipped (not using any docker-related feature)
svc-nginx → skipped (should be provided by the running system)
svc-pulseaudio → skipped (should be provided by the running system)
svc-selkies → ready for test → tested and looks ok

Once those are up:
svc-xorg starts (needs dbus, selkies, de, xsettingsd satisfied).
svc-xsettingsd starts (after nginx and xorg).
svc-de starts (after nginx, selkies, xorg).

So the graph resolves to:
(init oneshots) → (core services) → (Xorg + DE stack)
